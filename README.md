TODO
- switch between college and professional colors
- physically group by school/team/position (aka clumps)
- 'grouped selectors'
  - AFC/NFC
  - SEC/ACC/PAC etc
- some colors are too close,
  - cincinatti bengals and cleveland browns
  - san diego and jacksonville

Random things that might be possible in the future
- include continuous variables such as height/weight/salary/age and sort the vis somehow
